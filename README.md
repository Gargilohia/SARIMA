# SARIMA
SARIMA modelling is very similar to ARIMA modelling for non seasonal data, with added AR and MA terms that are seasonal in nature. ARIMA does not include seasonal data , and since we observe seasonality in the dataset, SARIMA models are better suited for prediction.In the ARIMA model (autoregressive integrated moving average), there are 3 terms, p,d,q that stand for autoregression order, difference and moving average order. Seasonal ARIMA has 4 seasonal elements, P,D,Q and m each of which denote seasonal AR, seasonal difference and seasonal moving average order. M stands for the lag value. The SARIMA model finally looks like :SARIMA (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m. We aim to stationarize the series using differencing and the SARIMA model will be built upon parameters obtained from the ACF/PACF plots
